Lorbit by Noah Libeskind
(A version of the game commonly known as "Astroids")

Description:
In this game you steer an out-of-control space ship. You can move it left and right, the goal is to avoid hitting meteors as you are rushing through space. As time progresses, your jets cause you to pick up more and more speed, try to survive by avoiding meteors at all costs. You earn a score that increases by 1000 every second, shoot for the high score.  

Technical:
The code has three classes, Obstacle, Spaceship, and Space. Obstacle creates and controls one single meteor, Spaceship creates and controls the spaceship. Space creates all the obstacles in the game. The main function controls the main loop for the game and deals with making all the classes work together.
